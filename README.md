# Post-COVID Demand Forecasting and Production Optimization in the Indian Automobile Sector  
### A Multi-Company Case Study Using Machine Learning, Game Theory & Streamlit  

---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview  
The COVID-19 pandemic caused a major disruption in the Indian automobile sector. With a surge in demand for personal vehicles, manufacturers rapidly increased production. However, as demand normalized, the industry faced **overproduction, high inventory, and heavy discounting (â‚¹1â€“5 lakh per vehicle)**.  

This project leverages **Machine Learning, Game Theory, and a Streamlit-based interactive dashboard** to:  
- Forecast post-COVID car sales  
- Optimize production planning across multiple automobile companies  
- Model strategic competition between auto manufacturers  
- Provide a **dynamic app for decision-makers**  

By integrating predictive analytics, optimization, and strategic modeling, the project aims to **minimize excess inventory, reduce discounts, and maximize profitability**.

## ðŸ”‘ Problem Statement  
The Indian auto sector witnessed **demand fluctuations post-COVID**, making it difficult for manufacturers to align production with actual sales. Incorrect planning resulted in:  
- **Excess inventory & high carrying costs**  
- **Revenue loss due to discounts**  
- **Underutilized capacity**  

This project proposes **ML-driven forecasting + optimization techniques + game theory models**, deployed through a **Streamlit application**, to help manufacturers make **data-driven production decisions**.

## ðŸ§° Methodology  

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Historical sales, production, and macroeconomic indicators (2020â€“2025).  
   - Sources: SIAM, Statista, industry reports, company filings.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Feature engineering (COVID dummy variable, fuel prices, interest rates, festive season effects)  
   - Normalization & scaling  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Post-COVID demand patterns  
   - Seasonal/cyclic sales trends  
   - Correlation between production & sales  

4. **Forecasting Models**  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Decision Tree Regression  
   - Random Forest Regression  
   - XGBoost Regression  

5. **Clustering (Demand Segmentation)**  
   - **KMeans Clustering** to segment demand by company/product/region  

6. **Optimization**  
   - Rule-based Thresholding  
   - **Linear Programming (LP)** for optimal production planning  

7. **Game Theory Analysis**  
   - **Cournot Model** for production competition  
   - **Nash Equilibrium** to model competitive strategies among multiple firms  

8. **Dynamic Application (Deployment)**  
   - **Streamlit App (app.py)** developed to:  
     - Allow company-wise demand forecasting  
     - Visualize sales & production trends interactively  
     - Run optimization models dynamically  
     - Simulate competitive scenarios between manufacturers  

9. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: **RMSE, MAE, RÂ²**
