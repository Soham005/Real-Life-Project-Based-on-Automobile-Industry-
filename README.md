# Post-COVID Demand Forecasting and Production Optimization in the Indian Automobile Sector  
### A Case Study of Mahindra & Honda Using Machine Learning and Game Theory  

## ðŸ“– Project Overview  
The COVID-19 pandemic caused a major disruption in the Indian automobile sector. With a surge in demand for personal vehicles, manufacturers such as **Mahindra** and **Honda** rapidly increased production. However, as demand normalized, the industry faced **overproduction, high inventory, and heavy discounting (â‚¹1â€“5 lakh per vehicle)**.  

This project leverages **Machine Learning** and **Game Theory** to:  
- Forecast post-COVID car sales  
- Optimize production planning  
- Model strategic competition between auto manufacturers  

By integrating predictive analytics and strategic modeling, the project aims to minimize excess inventory, prevent unnecessary discounts, and support profit-driven decision-making.

## ðŸ”‘ Problem Statement  
The Indian auto sector witnessed demand fluctuations post-COVID. Manufacturers faced the challenge of balancing **demand forecasting** with **production planning**. Incorrect forecasts resulted in:  
- **Excess inventory**  
- **Loss of revenue due to discounts**  
- **Inefficient capacity utilization**  

This project proposes **ML-driven forecasting + optimization techniques + game theory models** to tackle these challenges.

   - Sources: Industry reports, SIAM, Statista, company filings.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Feature engineering (COVID dummy variable, fuel prices, interest rates, festival months, etc.)  
   - Normalization & scaling  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Post-COVID demand trends  
   - Seasonal patterns  
   - Correlation between production and sales  

4. **Forecasting Models**  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Decision Tree Regression  
   - Random Forest Regression  
   - XGBoost Regression  

5. **Clustering (Demand Segmentation)**  
   - **KMeans Clustering** to identify product/region demand clusters  

6. **Optimization**  
   - Rule-based Thresholding  
   - **Linear Programming (LP)** to determine optimal production volumes  

7. **Game Theory Analysis**  
   - **Cournot Model** for production competition  
   - **Nash Equilibrium** for strategic decisions (e.g., plant expansion)  

8. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: **RMSE, MAE, RÂ²**
